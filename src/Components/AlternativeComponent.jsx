                            This is an advanced chatbot project that integrates a custom Agent, designed to operate both on WeChat and via a web interface, with synchronized conversation history across both platforms. The core Agent is built from the ground up, enabling it to leverage Python automation tools, which means it can perform tasks that other AI assistants simply cannot. Unlike traditional AI assistants that are limited to providing responses, this Agent can utilize your computer's resources to execute complex tasksâ€”provided these tasks are pre-defined in Python automation scripts.

                            What sets this chatbot apart is its ability to autonomously decide which script best suits a given task. It uses SoM (Set of Marks) to interact with the computer just like a human would, even managing to solve basic captchas. This makes the system incredibly versatile, requiring only Python automation expertise to expand its capabilities.

                            Key features include web queries, daily weather updates via WeChat, automated Weibo browsing, a Constitution assistant powered by a vector database, and summarization of Bilibili video content. This combination of features makes it a powerful tool for automation and AI-driven tasks that go beyond the capabilities of standard AI assistants.
